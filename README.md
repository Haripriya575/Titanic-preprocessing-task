 Titanic Dataset - Data Preprocessing Task

This task was done as part of an AI & ML Internship. It covers data cleaning and preprocessing steps on the Titanic dataset.

 What I Did:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Handled missing values (Age, Embarked)
- Dropped irrelevant features (like Cabin)
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
- Normalized numerical columns (Age, Fare)
- Detected and removed outliers using boxplots and IQR method
 Libraries Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
